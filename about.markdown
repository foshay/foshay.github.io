My work has recently introduced a no/limited overtime policy, this has resulted in me having more free time than usual. I thought, why not practice my documentation skills while also conferring to the 'Learn one, Do one, Teach one' mantra of mastering a subject.

Here I will be practicing my documentation skills, as well as sharing some fringe knowledge I have picked up throughout my days.

As a bonus: I will try and summarize what I have learned about github pages, jekyll, and anything else that pertains to the hosting of a 'blog' via github pages towards the bottom of my posts.
